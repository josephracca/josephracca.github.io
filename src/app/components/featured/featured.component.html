                    at Codestack Academy.</p>

                    currently wrapping up the design phase and will soon be working on a team of five developers to build the website using Velo by Wix and node.js.</p>

                    solution worked, but <em>didn't</em> because it timed out. After hours of re-thinking the problem, I
                    finally got to a working solution that passed all tests. It took a bit of sketching, a few dreams, aka nightmares, but at one point it just clicked and it was all worth it. It definitely worked out my brain and the point value for this one wasn't such a bad perk either.</p>
