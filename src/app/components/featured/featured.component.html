                    solution worked, but <em>didn't</em> because it timed out. After hours of re-thinking the problem, I
                    finally got to a working solution that passed all tests. It took a bit of sketching, a few dreams,
                    aka
                    nightmares, but at one point it just clicked and it was all worth it. It definitely worked out my
                    brain and
                    the point value for this one wasn't such a bad perk either.</p>
